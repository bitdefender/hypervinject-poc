# HyperVinject

This PoC injects a shellcode inside a user-mode process running in a Hyper-V child partition. The injection is performed from the root partition, and it requires admin privileges. 

Note that the root partition already has complete control over the running child partition; as a result, HyperVinject does not break any security boundary.

## Building the PoC

Build using VisualStudio. There are no external dependencies.

## Running the PoC

On the host (root partition), simply run the `vminject.exe` executable with the following arguments:
* the name of the target VM
* the ID of the target process running inside the VM

Example:
```console
vminject "Windows 11 24H2" 1280
```

The `vminjectdll.dll` DLL creates a log inside `D:\hypervinject\hypervinject.log`. This location can be changed by modifying `LOG_FILE` defined in `log.c`.

## Kernel shellcode

The assembly source code for the kernel-mode shellcode can be found in `shellcode\shellcode.asm`.

## User shellcode

Any user-mode shellcode can be used, but none is provided by default. Add your favorite user-mode shellcode in `shellcode.h`.

It is also worth mentioning from the beginning that this is not a 0-day or an exploit of any kind. Injecting code inside a running Hyper-V VM requires that the attacker already has admin access to the root partition, so no security boundaries are broken, since the HV, and by extension the root partition, already have full control over the child partition.
